- **Author:** SatishReddy Bathula
-  **Term:** Summer 2023
-  [Data_source](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
-  **Title:**  Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of the Yelp Dataset.
## What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
  The Yelp dataset I have chosen for this project due to its rich and diverse data on businesses, reviews, and user information. With comprehensive details on restaurants including location, categories, ratings, and reviews, the dataset offers practicality and real-world relevance. Moreover, the dataset presents a challenging and comprehensive task for building a restaurant recommendation and rating prediction system, involving textual data, user preferences, and diverse rating behaviors. By using the Yelp dataset, I can explore various algorithms and techniques in natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Ultimately, working with this dataset provides learning opportunities and allows me to research in these fields. Overall, the richness, relevance, popularity, and challenges offered by the Yelp dataset make it a compelling choice for developing an effective restaurant recommendation and rating prediction system.

  -  **Objectives:**
-  Perform an initial exploratory analysis of the Yelp dataset to understand the distribution of ratings, reviews, and other relevant variables.
-  Identify key factors influencing user ratings and review sentiment through feature analysis and correlation studies.
-  Utilize machine learning techniques, such as sentiment analysis and text classification, to predict sentiment polarity and identify key factors affecting positive or negative reviews.
-  **Expected Deliverables:**
-  A comprehensive report detailing the findings and insights obtained from the EDA and predictive modeling.
-  Visualizations, including plots, charts, and maps, to illustrate patterns, relationships, and model results.
-  Recommendations for businesses, users, and the Yelp platform based on the insights and predictive models developed.
-  **Results of the preliminary EDA:**
-  * Pennsylvania(PA) and Florida(FL) states has highest review count.
-  * There are 119698 restaurants in open condition and 30468 in closed condition.
-  * Observed the average rating of the whole restaurant dataset is 3.59.
-  * Distribution of ratings show that the ratings are mostly fall in the 3.5 to 4.0 range.
-  * Observed the top 20 business categories. 
-  * Restaurants and Food business has highest category counts.
